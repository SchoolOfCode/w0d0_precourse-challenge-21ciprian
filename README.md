## Tribute Page of Tyson Fury ##
> I chose to make a tribute page of **Tyson Furry** because I was really impressed of him as a human being.

> He went through so much adversity in the past, from winning world titles to depression, anexiety and suicidal thougts.

> He battled his demons and made it back to the top and became a world champion again!

> He is definitely an inspiration for milions of people that are not at their best mentally and physically and showing them that the good times will come eventually and I admire him for that.

> While I was working at this project I definitely learned more about the pros of using semantic HTML and used relative units in CSS(i.e: rem, em) instead of just px.
> I look forward for the start of the bootcamp next Monday and continue on building on top of the knowledge that I gain so far.
