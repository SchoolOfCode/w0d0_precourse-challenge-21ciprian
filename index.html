          Honestly, you may not see mental health, but believe me, it's real. People may act happy, smile, but inside they're hurting so bad. It takes a second to send a text to a loved one or friend to ask how they are. You are worth it, you are loved.

          <h2>Short Bio..</h2>
        <p>
          <span>F</span>ury is an example of an athlete who struggled in the aftermath of his own success. The issue for the Gypsy King was not with boxing but what to do after. He had achieved the only goal he had ever set in beating his true idol (Wladimir Klitschko) and with that now had a huge hole in his motivation of what he wanted to achieve. He sunk heavily into alcohol and drugs, maintaining little care for his primed athleticism, weighing 400lb and having little regard for his mental health, or his family. Fury himself described his state as “suicidal” and of being in some “really dark places” through depression and anxiety. He sought medical help and, within a year was back in the ring, winning two more fights before setting up a super fight with WBC champion Deontay Wilder. Despite the result of the first fight going down as a controversial draw, in the next two remaches against Wilder, Fury didn't leave it to the judges. He stopped Wilder and cemented his legacy as one of the greatest. He became an ambassador for mental health, especially when the issue of suicide has become an epidemic in his home nation. He is an inspiration to many who have had faced similar challenges and is an example for millions of how depression doesn’t define someone.</p>
